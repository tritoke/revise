# revise

These are a set of scripts I have made to help with making and viewing revision timetables.

## building

Once config.json has been edited to suit whatever revision schedule you want to follow, running
make in that directory will then create a csv file which represents the timetable and also
a PDF of the timetable which can be printed etc.

## dependencies

- latexrun
- make
- python3
